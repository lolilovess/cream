**how to help stitch this theme together without breaking the vibe**

hi!! 👋 if you want to help make **cream** even better, that’s amazing! but before you start touching the code in **notepad++**, there are some very strict "loli-approved" rules you have to follow. we don’t do corporate or messy code here.

---

## 📜 1. the golden rules (no exceptions)
if your pull request (PR) breaks these, it’s getting deleted immediately.

* **no pure white (#ffffff)**: we are a strictly "anti-trash-white" repository. if i see an `#ffffff` in your code, i'm going to assume you didn't read the docs. use ivory, almond, or parchment tones only.
* **keep it curvy**: if you add a new element, it better have a `18px` border-radius. if it’s pointy, it’s wrong.
* **don't touch the font**: we use **comic sans ms** at weight **800**. don't try to "clean it up" with a boring sans-serif font. we like it nerdy.
* **black and white integrity**: any new icons must be compatible with a grayscale/high-contrast filter to match my character.

## 🧶 2. what we actually need help with
since i'm busy with crochet and beating hard levels, here is what you can actually help with:

* **finding "blue" leaks**: if you find a part of the light-blue theme that we haven't hijacked yet, please find the variable and kill it with a cream override.
* **fixing discord updates**: sometimes discord updates their class names and breaks our "sturdy-stitch." if you find a broken button, please fix the selector!
* **more cute details**: if you have an idea for a subtle gold accent or a cute message bubble tweak, let's hear it!

## 🛠 3. how to submit a change
1. **fork it**: make your own copy of the repo.
2. **notepad++ only**: do your work in notepad++. keep the formatting clean and carefree.
3. **test the hijack**: make sure your changes work even if the user has a "light blue" theme selected.
4. **be nice**: write a cute description of what you changed. don't be corporate.

---

## 🛑 4. a note on personal info
do not ever include my personal info, location, or travel details in your commits or comments. keep it strictly about the code and the craft.

---

## 🏁 final check
* is it cream? ✅
* is it comic sans? ✅
* is it bold? ✅
* did you avoid using #ffffff? ✅

if yes, then let's see what you've got! thanks for helping me keep the cozy vibes alive. 🧶✨

**- loli**
