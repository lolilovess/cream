# 🍰 Contributing to Cream Theme

Hi! I'm **loli**! 👋 I'm so happy you want to help make this theme even cuter. To keep the vibes happy and the code clean, please follow these little rules:

## 🎨 Design Guidelines
* **Keep it Creamy:** Stick to the cream, tan, and gold palette.
* **Comic Sans is Law:** We use `Comic Sans MS` (Bold) here. Please don't change the font to something "serious."
* **Stay Round:** Use `--rounded-corners: 25px` for new buttons or containers. 

## 🛠️ How to Help
1. **Report Bugs:** If Discord updates and the theme breaks (again), please open an Issue!
2. **Submit Changes:** - Fork the repo.
   - Make your changes in a new branch.
   - Send a Pull Request (PR)!
3. **Comment your Code:** I like my CSS to be easy to read. Add cute comments like I did!

## 🏁 The Black & White Rule
My favorite character is **Black and White**. If you add any new icons or special features, try to include a tiny black and white accent somewhere as a secret easter egg!

## 📜 Legal Stuff
By contributing, you agree that your code will also be licensed under **GPL v3.0**. This keeps the theme free and open for everyone forever!

**Thank you for being awesome! 🍦**
