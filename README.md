# 🧸 Cream Theme

A super cute, cream-colored Vencord/BetterDiscord theme designed for fast typing and happy vibes! Inspired by vintage stationery and high-end paper.

## ✨ Features
* **Cozy Palette:** Soft `cream-paper` background with `gold-foil` accents.
* **Ink Typography:** Uses `text-ink` (#4a3b2a) which is a dark brown that’s much easier on the eyes than pure black.
* **Sticky Note Messages:** Chat bubbles that look like semi-transparent notes.
* **Soft UI:** Rounded corners (25px) for a bubbly, modern feel.
* **Font:** Forced **Comic Sans MS** (Bold) for the ultimate "handwritten notebook" aesthetic.

## 🔧 Customization
Hi, I'm **loli**! 👋 I made this easy to edit. 
If you want to change the colors, just look at the `:root` section at the top of the CSS file:
* Change `--gold-foil` for different highlights.
* Change `--cream-paper` if you want a different "paper" vibe.
