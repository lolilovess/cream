## 🧸 1. THE "LOLI-LAWYER" EXPLAINER (tl;dr)
listen, i know legal documents are usually a wall of boring gray text that makes you want to close the tab. but this one is different. this is the **GNU General Public License v3.0**, but with a crochet soul. 

basically, i spent countless hours in **notepad++** fighting "trash white" (#ffffff) and making sure the **comic sans** looked exactly like a pro-gamer-stitch. i did the hard work so you don't have to. in exchange, i only ask for one thing: **don't be a corporate gatekeeper.**

## 🖋️ 2. YOUR RIGHTS (THE GOOD STUFF)
under this license, you have the "freedom to stitch." this means:

* **FREEDOM TO SHARE**: you can send this file to your friends, your family, your crochet group, or a random person on the internet. spread the ivory vibes. 🍦
* **FREEDOM TO MODIFY**: if you think a specific button should be a different shade of almond, go for it! change the code, add your own stitches, and make it yours.
* **FREEDOM TO RE-DISTRIBUTE**: if you make a "strawberry cream" or "mint cream" version based on my code, you are allowed to share it! just make sure you give me credit for the original sturdy-stitch base.

## 🧶 3. THE "STURDY-STITCH" REQUIREMENTS (THE RULES)
this is a **"copyleft"** license. that sounds nerdy, but it just means:

1. **KEEP THE VIBE OPEN**: if you change my code and release your own version, you **MUST** use this exact same license. you cannot take my handmade ivory code and turn it into a private, closed-source project. 🛑
2. **NO CORPORATE SECRETS**: if you share a modified version, you have to show the code. no hidden "trash white" scripts or weird tracking. stay transparent.
3. **MAINTAIN THE REPUTATION**: if you break the theme while editing it, tell people it's your fault, not mine! i only ship the sturdy stuff.

## 🌊 4. THE CHRONICLES OF LIABILITY (THE "DON'T SUE ME" PART)
this part is extra large because it's important. 

i am a person with a crochet hook and a dream. i am providing this code **"AS IS."** * **NO WARRANTY**: if discord updates and your screen turns into a glitchy matrix, that’s not on me. 
* **NO GUARANTEES**: i don't guarantee that this theme will make you better at crochet (though it might). 🧶
* **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: if you accidentally delete your themes folder while trying to install this, i am not responsible for the despair that follows. i’ve already had enough despair during the **v1.0 mica era** to last a lifetime.

## 🏁 5. THE ULTIMATUM ON "TRASH"
even though this is a legal GPL-3.0 document, i am adding a **social contract** to it. 

if you use this license to create a fork of **cream**, you are legally (spiritually) obligated to never use `#ffffff` for a background color. if i find out you've turned this beautiful ivory parchment into a blinding white flashbang, the crochet community (and me) will be very disappointed.

## 📜 6. THE FULL LEGAL TEXT
if you actually want to read the 30,000+ words of the **official GNU GPL v3.0**, you can find it here: [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)

but honestly? just follow the crochet vibes, keep the code open, and don't be corporate. 🏁✨
