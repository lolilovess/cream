# 🍦 The Cream License 🍦

### 💖 TL;DR (loli's version)
* ✨ **Be a Sweetheart:** Don't take my code and say you made it. That's no fun!
* 📖 **Stay Open:** If you use this to make something new, you gotta share the recipe too! 
* 🖋️ **Keep the Ink:** Please leave my name in the credits. It looks pretty there!
* 🚀 **Remix allowed:** Feel free to change, break, and fix things as much as you want!
